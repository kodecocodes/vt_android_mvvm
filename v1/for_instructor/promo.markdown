## MVVM for Android

Welcome to MVVM for Android, a course for intermediate Android developers.

Are you tired of your app code being stuck in Activity and Fragment classes and mashed up with the app lifecycle? Using an architecure pattern like MVVM allows you to separate your app's code in a coherent way.

Complete my course and you’ll be able to use MVVM to structure your app into separate layers that each have a well-defined purpose.

You’ll learn about ViewModels, repositories, testing, data binding, Android Architecture Components, and much more.

This course is available now, for raywenderlich.com subscribers. Enjoy!
